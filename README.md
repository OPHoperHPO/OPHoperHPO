### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### :bust_in_silhouette: About me:
I am a developer from Russia. \
I am actively interested in the topic of neural networks. \
I program a variety of projects in focus, for example, I write programs for microcontrollers, I do projects with neural networks, I write my own modules for a smart home, backend development, etc. \
I know such programming languages as Kotlin and Python.
### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
I am currently working on a **free open source alternative** to `remove.bg`, namely a [tool to automatically remove the background from photos using neural networks.](https://github.com/OPHoperHPO/image-background-remove-tool)
